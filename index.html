                <h3>• BACKEND DEVELOPMENT</h3>
                <p>I make sure all my work is organized and neat. I do good on making plugins for frameworks like Helix and impulse, I'm decent at entities, and I'm okay at systems with data (saving, loading).</p>

                <h3>• UI DESIGN & IMPLEMENTATION</h3>
                <p>I enjoy designing and creating UI, and I do well with and without assets, such as materials.</p>

                <h3>• EXPERIENCE</h3>
                <p>I focus on Lua, and have spent a little over a year working on several projects. I prefer to get paid for my work, but I'll often do work for free.</p>
